# ZConnect Demo Front End

## Development

`npm start`

`npm run server`

devServer runs on `localhost:3000`

It's possible to use a mix of mock api server and real / local server instance by setting the `proxy` options in webpack.config.js as described (here)[https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-proxy]
